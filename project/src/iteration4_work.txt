We started working on the new functions jointly, and once we had it compiling and passing up to around 100 characters, Chris worked on the .cpp file generation to the point of correctly generating the Transitions. We then met up and worked together on finishing it up, Chris mostly working on the .cpp file, Harshita on the .h with a bit of crossover both ways, but once we had the base for the generations, we came together to debug and make them work.
