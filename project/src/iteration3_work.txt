For the UML diagrams of lab 9, we divided it up how the lab recommended, with Harshita doing the top half and Chris doing the bottom.

When it came to implementation, though, most of the work was done jointly. We started off each trying to implement the classes that we had made UML diagrams for, and we did name a few functions and add in a few structural things we expected to use, but those were like rough sketches and we only ended up using half or less of what we originally planned for, then we came together to polish them up and discuss what functionality we really needed to have. Chris put in a little extra time at home for bug resolution, but the writing of most of the test cases, classes, and their implementations in parser.cpp was done together on campus.
