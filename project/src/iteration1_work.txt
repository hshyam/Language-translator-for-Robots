Most of the project was done jointly. Design and planning was done together (we based it off WordCount, which we also worked on together in lab). Chris did the test cases while harshita did the regex matching. The debugging work was done together. Chris setup the linked token lists. regex definitions and scanner.h classes was worked on together. Most of the joint work was done using Chris's CSElabs account, so he submitted most all the files to the group repository.
